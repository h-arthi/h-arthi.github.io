                            The objective of this project was to develop a functional prototype speed detector utilizing HB100 Doppler Radar technology. 

                            By leveraging the Doppler effect, this radar device measures the velocity of moving objects by analyzing the frequency shift 
                            
                            between emitted and reflected signals. A display board for this system was also designed.
                            
                            This prototype was designed with the aim to accurately calculate the speed of objects based on the measured frequency variations,

                            and was a collaboration between two other students and myself.</p>
