                    Over the course of two weeks, a project to construct a 2-wheel smart robot car (car) using an Arduino UNO microcontroller 
                    that could follow a line track was carried out. To make a line following the car, an IR sensor had to be soldered individually 
                    to be attached to the car to enable line following. Upon the soldering and attaching of the IR sensors to the car, 
                    the car was programmed to complete a given track within a period.

                    Once the given track was completed within the time limit, additional features were added to the car.
                    Additional features included an SN-HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Module, Bluetooth Serial Transceiver HC-05,
                    and two Encoder Sensors. These additions were used to create an obstacle-avoiding car, remote and voice-controlled car, 
                    as well as a car that could calculate the distance it travelled. Each of the additional components were programmed to function

                    The biggest challenge to overcome throughout this project was during the soldering process was the
                    troubleshooting of the light detecting circuit on the Veroboard (IR Sensor). After 3 attempts of resoldering 
                    components on multiple Veroboards, a fully functioning IR sensor was produced. From the troubleshooting process, 
                    it was found that the issues faced were that a faulty IC socket was used, and the components were not soldered properly 
                    shorting the Veroboard across. After the third attempt it was ready to be attached to the car along with another ready-made 
                    IR sensor to enable it to follow the given black line track within a period. The IR sensor was deemed fully functional after 
                    going through the same testing as the light detecting circuit.

                    The three main objectives of this project were fulfilled after a duration of two weeks which were constructing a fully functional light 
                    detecting circuit on a breadboard and soldering a fully functional IR sensor on a Veroboard, the car completing the given track as shown
                    within a period of 79 seconds, and attaching additional components to the car to increase its functionality. The SN-HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Module 
                    was used in producing an obstacle-avoiding car, the Bluetooth Serial Transceiver HC-05 was used in producing a car that could be controlled via Bluetooth 
                    communication either by remote or voice command and two Encoder Sensors which calculated the distance travelled by car. The fully functional car is as shown.
