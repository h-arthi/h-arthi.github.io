                As a dedicated 4th-year (Masters) Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at the University of Nottingham, 
                I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. 
                I have completed internships at both ABB and Western Digital, where I gained hands-on experience through 
                projects I was involved in. At ABB, I focused on robotics, 
                while my time at Western Digital I was part fo the firmware development team. These experiences have honed my skills 
                and fueled my ambition to innovate and excel in the field of electrical & electronic engineering. 
                I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities that challenge and expand my expertise.
                <br><br>
                You can explore my projects by accessing the project section located at the top right corner of this website. 
                This will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the work I have undertaken.
